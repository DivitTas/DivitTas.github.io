# 🌐 itsdivit.me — My Personal Website

Hey there 👋 I'm **Divit**, a student who loves physics, math, computers, and occasionally screaming high notes when code refuses to run.  
This repo hosts the code for my personal website — [itsdivit.me](https://itsdivit.me).

## 🚀 What’s this site about?

It’s basically **me on the internet** — a portfolio, playground, and occasional experiment in chaos.  
You’ll find:
-  Projects I’ve worked on (games, AI stuff, physics simulations, etc.)
-  Things I build for fun
-  My thoughts, write-ups, and random obsessions
